## Core Node

Reasoning and coordination.
Single active core at any time.

## Hub Node

External interface and utilities.
Only node exposed to the internet (via tunnel).

## Edge Node

Autonomous, intermittent, battery-powered.
Never a dependency.

## Worker Node

Optional compute expansion.
Disposable by design.
