# ORION — Roadmap

## Current State

**Phases 0, 1, and 2 are COMPLETE.**

ORION is running in **N0 observe-only mode**. The system observes infrastructure, correlates events into incidents, and reasons about them—but all decisions are NO_ACTION. Media stack (Jellyfin, Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr, qBittorrent) and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) are deployed on 2x Raspberry Pi 5 with 3TB HDD storage. No autonomous behavior is enabled. Human intervention required for all actions.
