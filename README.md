# ORION

ORION is a modular, long-term homelab designed around **autonomy**, **SRE principles**, and **controlled intelligence**.

It is not a chatbot, not a gadget, and not a science-fiction assistant.
ORION is a **self-observing system** that understands its own state, decides cautiously, and acts only when safe.

## Core Objectives

- Autonomy with guardrails
- Stability over complexity
- Explainable decisions
- Human-in-the-loop for risky actions
- Long-term memory without resets
- Hardware and topology agnostic

## Fundamental Rules

- Observation precedes action
- Inaction is preferred to risky action
- No opaque automation
- No dependency on edge devices
- No fake high availability
- No blind AI execution

## Node Roles

- **orion-core**: reasoning, memory, decision logic
- **orion-hub**: external access, media, storage
- **orion-edge**: autonomous edge devices (robot)
- **orion-worker**: optional compute expansion

Nodes are replaceable. Roles are stable.

## Status

Active, evolving, and intentionally documented.
