# Phase 4.1 Plan 01: Go Project Setup Summary

**Go module initialized with dependencies and project structure established**

## Accomplishments

- Go module created at `bus/go/` with 4 key dependencies
- Standard Go project layout (cmd/, internal/, pkg/)
- Entry point with graceful shutdown pattern
- Makefile for code generation and testing
- Module README.md following ORION standards

## Files Created/Modified

- `bus/go/go.mod` - Go module definition (go-redis/v9, santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6, uuid, testify)
- `bus/go/go.sum` - Dependency checksums
- `bus/go/cmd/orion-bus/main.go` - Service entry point with signal.NotifyContext shutdown
- `bus/go/Makefile` - Build and generation targets (generate, test, build, clean)
- `bus/go/README.md` - Module documentation following ORION standards
- `bus/go/internal/.gitkeep` - Preserve internal/ directory structure
- `bus/go/pkg/contracts/.gitkeep` - Preserve pkg/contracts/ directory for generated code
- Project structure directories (internal/bus, internal/validator, internal/shutdown)

## Decisions Made

- **Using santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6 instead of kaptinlin/jsonschema**: The kaptinlin library has a dependency on Go 1.25 (which doesn't exist), causing build failures. The santhosh-tekuri library is the fallback option from the research and supports JSON Schema Draft 2020-12.
- Using go-redis/v9 v9.17.2 (official client, mature, matches research recommendation)
- Using google/uuid v1.6.0 for UUID generation
- Using stretchr/testify v1.11.1 for testing assertions
- Standard Go project layout following community conventions
- signal.NotifyContext for graceful shutdown (Go 1.16+ pattern)
- Makefile targets defined but code generation deferred to Plan 03

## Issues Encountered

**kaptinlin/jsonschema dependency conflict**: The library requires Go 1.25 which doesn't exist. Resolution: Switched to santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6 as recommended in the research as a fallback option. This library supports JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 and has high adoption (140 projects).

## Verification Results

All verification criteria passed:

- ✅ `go mod verify` passes
- ✅ `make build` compiles without errors
- ✅ `./bin/orion-bus` starts and responds to SIGTERM gracefully
- ✅ Project structure matches standard Go layout
- ✅ README.md follows ORION module standards
- ✅ All 4 dependencies present with correct versions (go-redis/v9, jsonschema/v6, uuid, testify)
- ✅ No errors or warnings from go toolchain (except benign GOPATH warning)

## Next Step

Ready for 04.1-02-PLAN.md (Core Bus Implementation)
