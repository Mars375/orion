# SAFE Actions Allowlist
#
# Actions classified as SAFE can be executed automatically by ORION
# at autonomy level N2 or higher WITHOUT human approval.
#
# Criteria for SAFE classification:
# - Action is fully reversible
# - Action has no external side effects
# - Action cannot damage hardware or data
# - Action is read-only or notification-only
# - Failure has minimal blast radius
#
# Default behavior: If an action is not explicitly listed here, it is NOT SAFE.

version: "1.0"

safe_actions:
  # Observability and notifications
  - action_type: "send_notification"
    description: "Send alert via Telegram or other notification channel"
    reversible: false
    external_side_effects: true  # Sends external message
    justification: "Notifications are informational only and cannot cause harm"
    max_frequency: "5 per minute"  # Prevent spam

  - action_type: "acknowledge_incident"
    description: "Mark incident as acknowledged in ORION state"
    reversible: true
    external_side_effects: false
    justification: "State change is internal and reversible"
    max_frequency: "unlimited"

  - action_type: "run_diagnostic"
    description: "Execute read-only diagnostic commands"
    reversible: true
    external_side_effects: false
    justification: "Diagnostics are read-only and produce logs only"
    max_frequency: "10 per hour"  # Prevent resource exhaustion
    constraints:
      - "Must be read-only commands only"
      - "No write operations permitted"
      - "Timeout enforced at 30 seconds"

# Actions NOT listed above are implicitly NOT SAFE and require
# classification in actions_risky.yaml or explicit denial.
